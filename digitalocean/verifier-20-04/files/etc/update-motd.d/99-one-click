Welcome to Block Sentinel's 1-Click Nyzo Verifier Droplet.
To keep this Droplet secure, the UFW firewall is enabled.
All ports are BLOCKED except 22 (SSH), 9444/tcp (Nyzo) and 9446/udp (Nyzo).

Nyzo is an open-source, highly decentralized, democratic, and highly efficient
blockchain. The block time is seven seconds, and the system scales well to high
transaction volumes.

On the server:
  * Verifier settings and private keys are located in /var/lib/nyzo/production
    Please make sure to back up your private key and never share it with anyone!
  * The verifier source code is located in /var/lib/nyzo/verifier
